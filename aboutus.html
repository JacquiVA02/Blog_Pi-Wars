                My personal goal through this competition is to hone my skills as a software engineer in a practical and challenging environment. I intend to expand my expertise in programming autonomous and remotely controlled vehicles, especially focusing on the implementation of algorithms on the Raspberry Pi 5. In parallel, I seek to improve my web development skills by creating and maintaining a blog in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where I will document the process and share my learnings. This project will not only allow me to contribute to the community of enthusiasts and professionals, but will also reinforce my practical knowledge in robotics and programming. This comprehensive approach complements my academic background in software engineering, being a crucial step in my professional development before completing my undergraduate studies.</td>
